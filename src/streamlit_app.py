'''
OCR Text Extraction Streamlit Application

This module implements a complete OCR pipeline with a Streamlit user interface. Users can upload images or archive files (.zip, .7z, .rar). 
Uploaded files are saved locally, archives are extracted, and images are processed using a black ROI filter and OCR steps. 
Outputs include processed images preview, a side-by-side CSV of OCR results, and downloadable ZIP and CSV files.
