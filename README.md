# rfi-text-extractor

This project aims to automate the RFI documentation process, thereby minimizing the time spent manually transferring data from RFI documents to Microsoft Excel.

The automation will involve the following steps:

1. Identify and extract the region of interest (ROI) from the RFI image using OpenCV for image processing.
2. Employ libraries to extract numerical data from the identified ROI.
3. Input the extracted data into a CSV file for easy conversion and further processing.
